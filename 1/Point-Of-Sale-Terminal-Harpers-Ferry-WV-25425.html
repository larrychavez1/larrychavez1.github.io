This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
