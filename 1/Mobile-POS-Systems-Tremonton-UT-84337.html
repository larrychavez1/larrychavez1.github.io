<p>In order to use the bar POS software you will need hardware. Erply is a next-generation web-based retail POS software built for SMBs. A point of sale system is used to track and manage your inventory and ring up sales. See customer histories like balance owed, credit available, loyalty program status, and special offers at the top of your transaction screen every time you ring up a sale. The CLYO Systems cash register software makes it possible to manage the restaurant's floor plan and tables, build menus and display inventory in real time.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>

<p>Good retail management software should print barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item in the last shipment. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entr√©e or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
