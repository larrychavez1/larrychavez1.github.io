<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>
