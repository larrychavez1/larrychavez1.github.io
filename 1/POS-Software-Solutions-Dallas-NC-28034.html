Typically, the term ‘ point of sale ' (often shortened to ‘POS') applies to the combined functions of a hardware device or devices and related software that provides the ability for a merchant such as a small business or sole trader to process payments for products or services.</p>
<p>Lightspeed POS runs on iPad or desktops, and its hardware packages include scanners, receipt printers, iPad stands, and cash drawers.

With a more efficient service, restaurants gain increased customer satisfaction.

<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must.

With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.

Common POS systems include a computer, receipt printer, lockable cash drawer, a scanner to read the bar code, a magnetic swipe reader and a modem and pole display. POS software companies can be found right online with just a simple search, and you will even find open source POS software, but again I suggest that you stay far away from it.
