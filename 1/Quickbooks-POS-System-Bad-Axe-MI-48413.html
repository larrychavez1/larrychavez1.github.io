Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Consequently, you should be able to freely embed card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, cash drawers, etc. Equipping your bar service and table service programs with these handheld devices will allow your staff to provide guests with the best possible service.
