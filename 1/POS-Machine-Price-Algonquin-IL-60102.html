<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. In modern terms, a POS system is typically a POS software product installed on a touchscreen hardware device. Maitre'D POS by Posera is a POS software designed for quick service and full table service restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. The Revel Bar POS system is equipped with tools to help entrepreneurs maximize their bar business. Features allow restaurants to create table maps, easily update menu items and monitor sales in real time through the Upserve mobile app.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>

Newer technology services on the market like cloud-based and hybrid point of sale solutions run on iPads and tablets where your data is synced and stored online and eliminates the need for an on-premise server like with legacy software and hardware.</p>
<p>A well-designed dashboard gives managers an overall view of their business with sales, promotions, inventory, and transaction reports. Have confidence that you can make commitments to your customers that your business can fulfill. They will also track your employees, inventory, and customers.

<p>Its menu intelligence leverages POS data and cloud technology to help you optimize menu and inventory management. Once the inventory code is entered, the systems call up the standard or sales price, compute the price at multiple quantities and provide a running total. To find the best POS systems for small businesses, we asked small business owners which systems they use and what they like and dislike about them.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.
