<p>The technology of EPoS or Electronic Point of Sale, has modernized the entire hospitality industry by making its transactions more swift and 100% accurate. By supporting every possible customer path through the retailer's ecosystem with consistent approaches to promotions, customer returns and exchanges, earning and redemption of loyalty rewards, use of gift cards and digital passes (electronic coupons), iVend POS ensures the most uniform consumer experience, irrespective of how your customers shop. So in order to accelerate the process developed software together with an improved hardware will improve the quality of service and increase the level of customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

For example, Square offers a customer loyalty program where customers earn redeemable points on sales.</p>

Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>
