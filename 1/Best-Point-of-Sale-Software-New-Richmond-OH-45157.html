By supporting every possible customer path through the retailer's ecosystem with consistent approaches to promotions, customer returns and exchanges, earning and redemption of loyalty rewards, use of gift cards and digital passes (electronic coupons), iVend POS ensures the most uniform consumer experience, irrespective of how your customers shop. So in order to accelerate the process developed software together with an improved hardware will improve the quality of service and increase the level of customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed.

POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>
