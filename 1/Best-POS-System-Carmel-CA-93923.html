<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>This meant that the business either opted not to accept those forms of payment or accepted them knowing that there was a possibility that they would never actually receive the payment as it was hard to verify the accounts.
