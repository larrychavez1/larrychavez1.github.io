<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>
<p>So when you're at your favorite restaurant or retail shop, and you make a purchase, you are completing a point-of-sale (POS) or a point of purchase (POP) transaction. Loyalty and rewards programs will keep customers coming back time after time, and is a feature that retail POS systems can't handle.

<p>Built specifically for restaurants, Toast brings together many solutions from integrated online ordering and loyalty programs to payroll and labor and sales reporting, all on a mobile, cloud-based POS system.

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Interfaces with hotel property management systems. By empowering servers with software that can provide myriad services, they can be more efficient and accommodating for customers. A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Users can upgrade to more substantial SalesVu POS paid plans later if they grow fond of it.</p>
<p>So these POS systems have powerful tools for quickly taking orders in the front of the house and keeping up with the hectic operations and inventory needs in the back. Such a capability will ensure that the bar menu updates in real-time and in accordance with inventory changes.
