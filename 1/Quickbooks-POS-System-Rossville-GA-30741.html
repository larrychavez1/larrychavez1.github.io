<p>A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations. Let your customers shop their way with the ability to refund or exchange online purchases at any retail location.</p>
