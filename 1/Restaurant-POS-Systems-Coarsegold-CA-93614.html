<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>

<p>Some bars even implement mobile POS systems at tables, which allow customers to order, pay and perform other collective actions, without having to attract the attention of the staff. Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>

<p>Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough. By integrating your POS system with the ERP system, Business Central , you avoid entering the same data in multiple systems as all transactions are posted automatically.

From inventory tracking to detailed reports and integrations with other business management tools, point of sale software should adapt to your business needs — not the other way around.
