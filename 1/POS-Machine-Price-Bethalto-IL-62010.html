<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>A great POS solution will not only improve your business, but it will also enhance the overall customer experience. Relying on an iPads is also a big perk, as it saves space and makes it easy for servers, hosts, managers, and bartenders to create and edit orders anywhere. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>

More sophisticated POS software will actually compile data on purchases, customer history (so that big spenders can get premiere treatment), what items are moving well and what items stay stagnant. When staff members spend more time with your guests, your bar or nightclub's efficiency and reputation drastically improve.</p>

Bartenders should know how to make any drink order a customer can throw at them, even if it's not on the menu.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
