<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. Some packages are designed specifically for food and beverage service businesses, like TouchBistro and Toast. It can also mean that the system—software and cloud server—must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation. It has different modules for billing, database management, order token management, employee and staff management, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software.

A good POS system can speed up payment times, help waiters or bar staff to take large orders, and help kitchen staff to manage output effectively. You can't expect your clients to enjoy there shopping if they stand in a queue for 15 - 20 minutes, so be sure the point of sale (POS) retail side is fast.</p>
<p>Depending on the program, customers can store up points or earn rewards based on the amount of money they spend. Create, manage and control the database of multiple restaurant sites at one time. You either lose sales or have to rely on your cashiers to add and total your sales properly.

POS System Maintenance: Things in a restaurant are prone to get greasy, have food spilled on them and get dirty quickly.

The range for restaurant POS systems cost typically falls between $79 - $150 per month for software.
