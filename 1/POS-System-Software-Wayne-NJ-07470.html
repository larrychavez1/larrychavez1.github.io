<p>POS or Point of Sale refers to the system that records financial transactions in stores and restaurants. Veeqo is a POS and order management system that streamlines sales channels for multi-outlet e-commerce businesses. Cozy POS is a best restaurant management software which comes with features such as web portal access for remote outlet management, multiple outlet management and office management.

<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>

<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads.
