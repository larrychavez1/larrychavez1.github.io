In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>

You can use it to take orders tableside, track inventory at the ingredient level, manage customers, offer loyalty promotions and generate reports. With POS systems that offer this feature, you'll be able to track transaction history, take notes, and potentially even contact customers, all through your point of sale. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the US and Canada.</p>
