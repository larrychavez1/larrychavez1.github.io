The software comes with a powerful API, a key tool that offers retailers the freedom to integrate existing systems to achieve centralized management. The bar point of sale system by this provider is specifically designed to help your bartenders sell with ease and boost customer service. If you choose a cloud-based restaurant POS system, you'll be able to make changes to your menu or pricing on the fly. Its wide array of capabilities that include quoting, invoicing, and ordering, among others, makes the solution a complete retail management system, complemented further by robust reporting features, timesheet, and job functionalities.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well.
