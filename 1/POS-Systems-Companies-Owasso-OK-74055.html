<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>

Lavu utilizes advanced restaurant hardware and technology that include self-serve kiosks and digital menu boards, which make transacting and order taking quicker and more convenient. This should mean a terminal that is fast, easy to understand and quick to respond to the touch of the server, cashier or bar tender.</p>

The retail stores are cozier and less stressful for shoppers. Manage and view customers' order history and personal information. Larger restaurants and fine dining establishments may need things like multiple server stations, hostess station systems, bar server stations and several kitchen printers, but as a small restaurant you do not.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
