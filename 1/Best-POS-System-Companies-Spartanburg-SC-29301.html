<p>A Point of Sale (POS) system is indispensable for any type of retail business. Cloud-based Point of Sale software that easily adapts to support the evolving needs of customers. Some restaurant POS systems will even contain features to facilitate creating an online menu and delivery service that can be embedded into a website. Bar point of sale software also helps modernize your bar business by opening doors that grant access to cloud technology, mobile payments, and essential customer analytics data.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed.

POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>
