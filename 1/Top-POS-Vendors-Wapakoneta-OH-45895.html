<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step furtherâ€”they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>
