Depending on the needs of your business after you have achieved the minimum functionality, there are some other features you might want to look for such as the ability for customers to use two forms of payment for surge pricing, gift cards, or special pricing (for special customers or sales) to allow for returns.</p>
<p>Cost- Before finalizing the POS system, the user should consider the cost of it that includes the hardware and software price. This software has been around since 2008 and continues to be one of the best POS systems for retail. To get started, pair your POS software with one of our top inventory management software options. A vital element of POS hardware is the cash drawer.
