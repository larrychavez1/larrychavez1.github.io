<h3>Best Point Of Sale Systems For Online & Offline Retail New River Arizona</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>Harbortouch TablesideTM allows your restaurant's servers to input customer orders directly from the table via an Apple® iPad® for a dramatic increase in speed, service quality, and efficiency. Each time an item is ordered through the POS it is removed from the current inventory. Increase your sales and profitability by expanding your bar and alcohol business. For example, you may offer a self-service kiosk for patrons to purchase movie tickets, or you may have one to manage parking space time and payments.</p>

<p>Along with magstripes, most modern credit cards also come with embedded microchips that provide enhanced security features. But if you're specifically opening a pizza shop, for example, there are POS systems built just for that with integrations that allow online ordering and delivery tracking. Good POS software enables you to boost your ability to attract more customers and track and make sales depending on your needs.</p>

We include a full-featured employee management service at no additional cost. In-store customers account for 50% of all eCommerce activity, research by Salesforce found, so closing the online-offline gap is critical for customer experience.</p>
