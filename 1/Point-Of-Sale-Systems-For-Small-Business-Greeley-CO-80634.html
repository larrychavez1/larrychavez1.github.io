<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
