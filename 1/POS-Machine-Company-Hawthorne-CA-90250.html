<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>
<h2>Best Restaurant POS Systems Hawthorne</h2>

<p>Manage Specials - POS systems automate the process of tracking current and marked down pricing. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it.

Amazon's concept convenience store, Amazon Go, which deploys technologies that let shoppers come in, grab items, and walk out without going through a register, could revolutionize POS systems. A bar and grill, particularly a franchise where overhead is higher, properly tracking product popularity, sales and waste ultimately improves the overall bottom line of the restaurant.</p>
<p>Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory.
