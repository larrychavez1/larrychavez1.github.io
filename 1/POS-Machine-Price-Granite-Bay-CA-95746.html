<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Efficiently manage all your vendors, track invoices, and create purchase orders right from your retail software. Download the app for free and there is no monthly fee and credit card sales will appear in the merchant's account overnight. Personalized marketing solutions like AppCard for Retail Pro use transactional data from Retail Pro to trigger behavioral-based campaigns and keep shoppers engaged with your store.</p>

A bar POS with a strong inventory management system can track the alcohol poured in every cocktail and alert you when supplies of any ingredient are low.</p>

<p>Customers are able to access products they have added to their ecommerce shopping carts or wish lists at the point-of-sale and add them to an in-store transaction. Point of sale equipment allows for effective management of these programs. So, your staff at the restaurant, travel desk or any other POS outlet is always updated with the right information in real-time. A drawer connected to the POS used to safely store cash and coins.</p>
<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM. Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>

EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip.</p>
<p>You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. Because of the importance of accurate data capture in sophisticated point-of-sale systems, retailers are increasingly turning to scanning as an alternative to error-prone keypunch entry." Indeed, scanning became a ubiquitous feature in many of the nation's most modestly-sized retail outlets during the 1990s.</p>
