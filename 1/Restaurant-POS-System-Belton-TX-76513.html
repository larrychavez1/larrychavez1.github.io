Businesses will have different needs when it comes to point of sale hardware.</p>
<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years.

Today's point-of-sale software contains many more features in addition to the computerized cash register.

<p>The user purchases the POS system with hardware and accessories such as to monitor screen, cash register, barcode scanner, receipt printer, and card readers. Many restaurant owners are familiar with POS systems because basic versions are usually included in retail or restaurant packages Restaurant systems are normally equipped with a terminal, a touch-screen monitor, and a cash drawer.

<p>Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. Because traditional point of sale systems require you to run reports from an in-store terminal, your ability to make data-driven business decisions is limited to when you're at your business location. Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>
<p>Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports. Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges.
