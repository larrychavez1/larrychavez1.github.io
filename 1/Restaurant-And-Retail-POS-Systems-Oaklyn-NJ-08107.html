Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality. Easy to use - Tablet and mobile POS are easier to use because the staff is already familiar with using mobile devices so that the learning curve can be shorter over the traditional point of sale machines and software. Our parent company Point of Sale USA maintains a list of the top restaurant POS systems in the industry with individual reviews to help you compare and find the right solution for your business.</p>

<p>As an example, for a small business with one POS machine, we estimate you'll pay around $1,250 for hardware and about $69 per month for a software subscription.
