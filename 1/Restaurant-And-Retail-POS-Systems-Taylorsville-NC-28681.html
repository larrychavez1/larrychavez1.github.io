<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system.

<p>You can use the Point of Sales system on both desktop computers and mobile devices.

Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.</p>
<p>Mobile point of sale (mPOS) serves as the smartphone or dedicated wireless device that executes the task of a cash register or electronic point of sale (POS) device. Retail point of service (POS) systems empower retail staff to deliver memorable service levels and build customer loyalty in an omnichannel world.
