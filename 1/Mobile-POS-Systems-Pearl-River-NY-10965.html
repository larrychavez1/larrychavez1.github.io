<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>For over 40 years, RSI's commitment to the growing and fast changing worlds of Retail, Hospitality and Security has allowed us to partner with multiple POS and Security providers, making it possible to have a POS solution for every type of business. It cuts down on paperwork by automating the reconciliation of cash and card payments.
