<p>Wasp QuickStore options range from complete POS single store systems to multi-store. The inventory management module embedded in Lightspeed allows the business personnel to carry out their day to day activities in a highly organized manner. For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria. Real-time reporting — the option to generate real-time business reports, based on product sales and inventory data, is one of the key features that every multi-store retailer needs.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers. But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
