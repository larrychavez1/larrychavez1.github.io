<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>A point of sale system is like a computerized cash register, it has the ability to manage inventory, creates an easier system of taking orders, increases profit and will increase the overall productivity of both your wait and kitchen staffs. Remedy- More payment options should be given to the customers. It has an app-based design and is hosted in the cloud, meaning you check sales from your phone, update employee information from any computer, and quickly update software in just a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Streamline data from all selling platforms into one location, allowing you to spend more time making business decisions that grow your business.

Former nightclub and restaurant manager, Seth Harris, developed Upserve with specialty ordering and table and customer management. An obvious benefit of making restaurant reservations is that you know exactly how many customers you will feed and when.</p>
<p>As you may be aware, bar menus tend to change from time to time. POS is not a standalone machine or process - it's a constellation of things that together enable you to process customer-facing transactions efficiently and streamline business processes connected with your sales. Once you match the right POS system to your restaurant, you can streamline operations, increase staff productivity, reduce shrinkage, and maximize profits.</p>

<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. These applications would typically provide the same core functions, so watch out for other things like the hardware you would need to purchase on top of the software or which mobile platform it runs on. You would also do well to keep a keen eye on vendor reputation for providing timely updates and customer service.</p>
