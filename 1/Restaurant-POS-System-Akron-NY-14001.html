A POS system can increase profits by providing a quick and reliable check-out process, maintain detailed sales and inventory reports, and provide integrated profit increasing programs such as loyalty programs, coupons, and special discount programs.</p>
<p>A great POS solution will not only improve your business, but it will also enhance the overall customer experience. Relying on an iPads is also a big perk, as it saves space and makes it easy for servers, hosts, managers, and bartenders to create and edit orders anywhere. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>

Successful retail stores rely heavily on their software from online fulfillment systems to buy online pick-up in store (BOPIS), from tracking loyalty and employee hours to marketing via text and email messaging.</p>
<p>In addition, the POS system may speed up transactions - which is critical in a restaurant or coffee shop, for example, where a long line at the counter leads to grumbling customers.
