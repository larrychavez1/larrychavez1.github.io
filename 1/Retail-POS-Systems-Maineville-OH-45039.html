<p>Store owners, especially in these hard times, have to watch their pennies when investing in Point of Sale (POS) hardware.

Whether you're a full service, fine dining, fast food, or quick-service restaurant, you need a bar and restaurant POS system to manage your business. AccuCOUNT the inventory management system lets you handle pricing, take delivery orders wirelessly, and adjust inventory count.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
