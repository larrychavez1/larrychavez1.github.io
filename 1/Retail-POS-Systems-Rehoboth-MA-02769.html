Many POS software can be integrated to 3rd party software such as accounting software for bookkeeping, email marketing solutions, and ecommerce platforms for selling online.</p>
<p>As a case in point, some self-ordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table.
