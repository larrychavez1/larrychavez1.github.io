Credit card processing rates through Lightspeed Payments are set at a predictable fee for all card types, including American Express: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction (2.6% + $0.30 card not present). When your sales staff enter the customers' name, they can quickly call up their entire purchase history and their email address.</p>

On the other hand, the point of sale on the ecommerce platform is software working independent of hardware.
