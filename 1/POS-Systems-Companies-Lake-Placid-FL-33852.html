<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>ShopKeep Capital provides quick and easy merchant cash advances to ShopKeep merchants in good standing who need a fast business loan to buy inventory, hire employees, cover day-to-day operational expenses during slow times, etc. This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month.</p>

Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum.
