<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

The right POS software can speed up your in-store sales process, eliminate manual tasks, and improve the accuracy of your reporting. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store.</p>
<p>With a kiosk module, you can set up tablets as self-service kiosks that customers can use at restaurants to place and pay for their orders and at retail businesses to scan and pay for their items. As technology has advanced, so have POS systems, with the introduction of bar codes in the 1970s, graphical interfaces in the 1980s, and online ordering in the 1990s. Valuable reporting insights, ingredient-level inventory, and easy ordering will save you time and money.</p>
<p>Your wait staff will now be able to approach your customer with confidence about the quantity of items remaining and be able to quickly shift customers to other items when your daily specials are all sold out. Cash registers are often slower, and more limited in their options and methods of payment then a POS.
