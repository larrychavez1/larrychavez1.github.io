<p>Choosing your point of sale, or POS, systems could be a disaster if you approach the wrong dealer and go for the wrong equipment. This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp. The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. Its POS systems include inventory management, delivery tracking, time tracking and marketing tools. Combined with Upserves HQ and Upserve Payments, Upserve POS delivers the most advanced POS and restaurant management solution in the industry, purpose-built to improve guest experiences.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely. We'll start with what POS software can do.
