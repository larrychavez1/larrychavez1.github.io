<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
