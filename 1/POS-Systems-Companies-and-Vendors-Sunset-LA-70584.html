<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. A POS system has features that support the rationalization of a small or large retail business's day to day operations. Runs in Offline Mode: Even when you are offline, you can punch in orders and download business reports with LimeTray restaurant software. However, POS software is quite scalable and modules can be added for accounting, inventory and even customer relationship management (CRM.) Value priced software choices are available that can give a small shop owner some of the tools the large fortune 500 retailers use.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.

Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.
