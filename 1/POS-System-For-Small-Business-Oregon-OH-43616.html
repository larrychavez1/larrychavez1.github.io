<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. From cash, credit card, check, debit, on account, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, accept virtually all forms of payment. In retail stores, the mobile POS system helps in attaining consumer data, empowering employees, and generating more dynamic sales opportunities.</p>
