Connect with your customers: for those of you using a Yelp business user account, connect with all your customers and get their reviews to improve your business. Another factor that determines how much you'll pay for hardware is whether you use a legacy terminal or a mobile POS system.

<p>The basic purpose of a restaurant POS system is to facilitate orders and accept payment from customers. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management.

Track customers' buying behaviors and create targeted marketing campaigns to retain current customers and win new business.</p>
<p>Checkout times are fast-tracked by meeting customers where they are. Retail businesses can use the system for both stationary and mobile devices.

<p>Point of Sale (POS): The most important aspect of any point of sale (POS) retail side is speed, speed and speed. Plenty of businesses still get by with just a simple cash drawer and card reader.
