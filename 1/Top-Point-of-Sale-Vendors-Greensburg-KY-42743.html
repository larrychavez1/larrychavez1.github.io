<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is an iPad POS system that has solutions for retail stores, restaurants and online businesses. The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data. Upserve POS focuses on small restaurants but can also accommodate large, multilocation bars. For delivery restaurants, Revel lets employees quickly store customer information with an address field. Despite Cybersys POS's low pricing, it comes with all the features of your standard POS systems like ecommerce integration, reporting, inventory management, and employee access management.</p>

<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
