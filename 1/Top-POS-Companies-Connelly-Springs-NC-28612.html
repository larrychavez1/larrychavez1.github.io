<p>In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. When deciding on a bar POS system, it's important to talk to a representative to find out if they have all the features you need, and what they will cost—often, the starter” or core” package does not include more sophisticated features like advanced reporting, the loyalty program, or granular inventory controls.</p>

<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
