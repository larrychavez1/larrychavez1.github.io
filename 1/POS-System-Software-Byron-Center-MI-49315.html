<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Delivery management: Manage order deliveries from start to finish, ensuring on-time customer delivery. Big and medium sized retail stores are using this application without fail. This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes.

The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system.</p>

The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>
