<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Delivery management: Manage order deliveries from start to finish, ensuring on-time customer delivery. Big and medium sized retail stores are using this application without fail. This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes. Accurate, real-time communications in Retail Pro help you keep your inventory and customer information up to date across the entire business, so you can make better decisions from holistic, integrated business insights.</p>
<p>Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store. Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system.</p>

<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>

All the information in your POS, from menu items to payment information, is stored in the cloud. Offering EMV payment will provide your customers with peace of mind.</p>

Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum.
