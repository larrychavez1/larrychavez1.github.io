<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Pros: Offers more features than most, including some customer relationship management functionality. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb.

If you are operating a small or midsize bar, cloud-based POS software is likely the best option for your business. And with QuickBooks hardware and software, you can take any type of payment from just about any device—barcode scanner, touch screen terminal, iPad, or mobile reader.</p>

With the right POS software, you can provide your customers with more personalized services and allow them to have better and faster transactions with you. Revel Systems POS is actually a full-scale restaurant management system. SalesVu POS offers apps controlling transactions, inventory and employee management, CRM functions, and more.</p>
<p>Customer data capture and management are key in the development of our retail systems and Retail Pro allows for much improved processes and usability in terms of CRM and stock management. For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
<p>Bearing all these aspects in mind, consider getting a POS system that features flexible menu creation and management capabilities. Before computerised POS systems were developed merchants would have to rely on their own organisational and maths skills to run their business. It is fast, reliable, easy to learn and use with touch-screen technology - making ETP Store a retail POS software that turns your Point of Sale into a point-of-delight for both your customers and your store staff.</p>
