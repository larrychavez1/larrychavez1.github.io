<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations.

<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Eliminating a fixed bar POS system can raise a bar's customer experience to new heights by creating a modern sales experience that is rife with today's latest technology.
