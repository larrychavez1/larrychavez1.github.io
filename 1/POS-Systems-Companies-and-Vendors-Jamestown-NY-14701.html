<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately. A mobile web study found out that smartphones were used in over a third of total US retail sales in 2018 or equivalent to more than $1 trillion in purchases.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. Below we have compiled some of the most popular types of POS systems and what features and tools they usually come with to help you figure out what will most benefit your business.</p>
