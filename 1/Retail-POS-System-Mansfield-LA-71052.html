<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment â€”a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>Features include sales snapshots, void reports by employee, detailed credit card payment reports and detailed shift reports. Multi-store businesses, such as chains or franchises, will have access to the hierarchy feature, which allows businesses to easily manage and control simple to complex organisational business structures with accompanying access privileges. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.</p>

<p>The tipping function ensures accurate earnings calculations and easy tip splits at business close time. This feature allowed retailers to query their point-of-sale systems for up-to-date balances at a moment's notice. POS terminal serves as the physical equipment that allows merchants to process payments to complete a customer purchase. With a point of sale system at your restaurant, you're able to track kitchen performance and order times.</p>
<p>It supports omnichannel sales and has tools for inventory management, tiered pricing, purchase ordering, analytics, and email marketing and customer loyalty programs. Some tablet POS services are "free" with credit card processing; others require a low monthly subscription fee but allow you to choose your own credit card processor. Retail 4.0 is the way forward for points of sale systems. It comes with jeweler-specific features like instant quotes, custom orders, and stock counting with RFID and barcode support, as well as marketing tools like the ability to collect customer data (including wish lists) and view purchase histories.</p>

Receipt printer: Used to print receipts for customers or end-of-day reports for cashing up.</p>
<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM. Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>
