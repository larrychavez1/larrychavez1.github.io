<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Features include sales snapshots, void reports by employee, detailed credit card payment reports and detailed shift reports. Multi-store businesses, such as chains or franchises, will have access to the hierarchy feature, which allows businesses to easily manage and control simple to complex organisational business structures with accompanying access privileges. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.</p>

In addition to POS systems for restaurants, NerdWallet has compared a host of POS systems for other types of small businesses. Modern mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) software and credit card readers let businesses use mobile devices, like iPads, to process customer payments from almost anywhere.</p>
<p>Streamline and automate your retail operations, save hours of time each day, avoid double entering data, and trade seamlessly on multiple channels. In general, all bar POS systems fulfill most of the same functions as systems for other industries. TouchBistor offers better business insight for increased sales and customer service. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market.</p>

Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>

Vend can be used with any credit card processor that offers an payment gateway (which is most of them).
