<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>Inventory management is the process of controlling costs and waste through effective use of on-hand product. Epos Now is an award-winning POS system trusted by hospitality businesses like Best Western Hotels and Subway Restaurants. With a solid POS retail system, it will be easy to correlate that person or persons work schedule with the minute-to-minute sales information. Epos is easy to use so staff can start using the system almost immediately.</p>
