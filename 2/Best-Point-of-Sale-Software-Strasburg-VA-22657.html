<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients.

Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
