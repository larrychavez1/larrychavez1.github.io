Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.</p>

<p>POS systems help you track every sale, down to the penny while acting as a credit card processor. Food and beverage service businesses can benefit from Revel's customizable loyalty programs.

If a customer wants a certain style or color that is not available at their location, a store associate will save the sale by helping the customer place the order from the store's iPad before they go.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
