Acquire, retain and engage your customers, increase their average spend, manage inventory and visualize sales analytics. Wearables like Disney's Magicband may seem relegated to expensive experiences for now, but wearable computing will soon change how restaurants interact with customers and accept payment. Shopkeep POS has the best Retail POS System mobile app on the market. Understanding the basics of how point-of-sale (POS) systems work and the implementation process is essential to know, especially if you're looking to buy a new system.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks.

With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Toast POS is one of the few providers of an Android POS system, which is more suitable for restaurants due to the flexibility and affordability of the Android infrastructure.</p>

Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
