<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>
