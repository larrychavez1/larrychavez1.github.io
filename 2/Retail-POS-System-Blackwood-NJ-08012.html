<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Expiry Management: This software for restaurant billing in India assists in tracking expiry date of ingredients, so that you can return items to suppliers on time. Card payment starts by swiping the card - through MSR or a handheld device then taking customer's authorization for the specified amount. Plus, Cova is seed-to-sale compliant, integrating with statewide traceability systems like BioTrackTHC, Leaf Data Systems, and Metrc.</p>

A CPU, motherboard and memory will form the PC unit of the POS Hardware bundle, with the combination of POS input device like POS keyboard, smart card or credit card reader and barcode scanner; and output device, like customer pole display, LCD screen or touch screen, and receipt printer, all bundle together to form a proper Point of Sale machine.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely. We'll start with what POS software can do. As a reminder, the point of sale software is what you use in conjunction with POS hardware to run transactions. At many foodservice, retail, and hospitality businesses, the Point Of Sale (POS) system or Property Management System (PMS) has a built-in time and attendance system which may be sufficient.</p>
