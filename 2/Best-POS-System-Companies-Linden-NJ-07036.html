Pose is a cloud-based POS system that can be used by stores, cafes, booths, salons and service providers working on location.

From full service establishments to quick service franchises we have matched hundreds of independent restauranteurs throughout the country with the POS system they need to realize lasting success in a highly competitive industry. Point of sale (POS), a critical piece of a point of purchase , refers to the place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable.</p>
<p>This allows the owner to keep a close tab on his staff as well as customers. We are the largest resource out there for what we do; reviewing restaurant POS systems.

<p>You avoid entering the same data twice as all sales are automatically registered in the accounts. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
