Retailers need to consider the negative consequences of failing to have a POS in place. Successful retail stores rely heavily on their software from online fulfillment systems to buy online pick-up in store (BOPIS), from tracking loyalty and employee hours to marketing via text and email messaging.</p>
<p>You'll need to consider software for restaurant and bar inventory, purchase and invoicing, accounting, reservation, and scheduling. While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online.

<p>Mobile POS systems are always less expensive, especially if you already own tablets. To be completely accurate, we can say that POS refers to the hardware and software which cashiers use for checkouts. Identifying your customers is even faster with loyalty cards and customer barcode ids. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>
