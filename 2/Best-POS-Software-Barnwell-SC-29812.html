<p>The UnifiesPOS standard, to which all POS systems had to conform, was led by The National Retail Foundation. The staff management module makes managing your staff easy. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind. Then just plug everything in and install the right retail POS software.</p>
