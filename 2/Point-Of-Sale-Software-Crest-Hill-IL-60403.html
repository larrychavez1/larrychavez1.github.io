Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments.

I like this software because it never stops developing so that many new features have been added and always so helpful to my business.

DBSync , a pioneer in the field, allows for seamless integration, providing complete control over the business and optimizing sales. This feature helps protect a bar business from running out of product, which can be one of the most damaging forces to an exceptional customer experience.</p>

<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
