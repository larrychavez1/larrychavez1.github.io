You can close out or reconcile your cash drawer at any time and even have multiple shifts and multiple point of sale operators per shift. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server.</p>
<p>As retailers adopt new POS strategies, they will generate a wealth of data that will yield new insights into customer behaviour, inventory, pricing, sales trends and more. Restaurants will get the flexibility of changing the menu , menu style, and other menu options as per the need and requirement without any additional cost. IPOS plays an important role to improve sales processes, operational efficiencies, reporting accuracy and internal communications, and identify opportunities for cost reduction.</p>
