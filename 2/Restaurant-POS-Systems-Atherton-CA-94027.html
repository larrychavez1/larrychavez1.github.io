<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. For a while, on-site POS software has been the norm for computerised POS systems , but it is now more common to use cloud-based or hybrid systems relying on both the internet and local hosting.
