Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more.

Beyond ringing up sales and accepting payments, you want a system that streamlines related processes such as inventory and customer management. A retail POS system may also include a barcode scanner and customer-facing screen.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
