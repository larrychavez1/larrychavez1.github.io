<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>
