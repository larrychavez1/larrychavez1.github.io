<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. What Imonggo's free plan doesn't offer is broad integration capabilities, offline access, or the option to accept credit card payments. Once you've come up with a shortlist of potential POS systems, check out what businesses like yours are saying about them.

<p>The basic purpose of a restaurant POS system is to facilitate orders and accept payment from customers.

<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
