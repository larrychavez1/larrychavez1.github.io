<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>

Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports.

Our seamlessly integrated payment processing system comes as an extension of PAR's restaurant POS software and is fully supported by our service and customer support infrastructure.

Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
<p>The software permits you to issue receipts, track sales, and perform back-office functions. If the quality of the software, support, and services will prove itself as an investment — not just an extra business expense — it'll be worth it.
