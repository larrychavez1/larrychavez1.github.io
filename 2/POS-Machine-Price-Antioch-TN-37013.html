<h3>POS Technologies That Help Control Bar Liquor Inventory And Costs Antioch Tennessee</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>POS software is the technology used in tandem with point of sale hardware—such as a card reader mounted to a smartphone—to process and monitor sales, track inventory, store customer data, integrate with systems and databases, and a variety of other functions. With Toast POS , the bartender will not need to ask the customers for their cards multiple times for the tab. Hence, the customer support from YourGoGetter is available round the clock to solve all the problems as effectively and in as less time as possible.</p>
<h3>Complete Point Of Sale System Antioch TN 37013</h3>
<p>Key features include on-side and online ordering, payment, delivery, stock management, loyalty, reservations and analytics. Founded in 2004 in France, CLYO Systems creates payment and management solutions for restaurants, bars and cafés. Cloud-based POS software has become very popular in the business community, since it is affordable and easy to use. It's an end-to-end solution, with dedicated modules for online ordering, table reservations, POS, order management, IVR & CRM service, among others.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
