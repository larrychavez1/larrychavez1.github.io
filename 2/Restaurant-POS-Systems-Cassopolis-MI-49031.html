<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Or log in to your mobile app and view or print sales receipt easily. ShopKeep helps you keep track of your store inventory with no limit on the number of managed items and with reporting that goes down to the ingredient. No matter whether you choose to use other Point of Success products and services or stay with just our free restaurant software, Point of Success Special Edition will cost nothing to use. Now you've got all the info on the leading Retail POS Systems, it's time to choose and buy one.</p>

<p>Restaurants stand and fall on the quality of their food and the friendliness and dedication of their staff.

<p>It's not all third-party integrations, of course: Within the software interface itself, ingredients can be tracked individually through the inventory management features, a floor plan display helps guide servers to the table they need when they need it, and a menu that supports photos of each meal to be included with each description. Mentioned above is the list of some of the best restaurant management software available for purchase.</p>

<p>Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation.

<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
