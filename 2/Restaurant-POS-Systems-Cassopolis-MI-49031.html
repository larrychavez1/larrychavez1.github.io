<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Or log in to your mobile app and view or print sales receipt easily. ShopKeep helps you keep track of your store inventory with no limit on the number of managed items and with reporting that goes down to the ingredient.

Mentioned above is the list of some of the best restaurant management software available for purchase.</p>

Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
