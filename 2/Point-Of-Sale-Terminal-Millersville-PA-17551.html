Download the app for free and there is no monthly fee and credit card sales will appear in the merchant's account overnight.

The hardware components bundle will typically include a POS terminal, receipt printer, credit card reader, cash drawer, barcode scanner, kitchen or bar printer (for restaurants), and possibly even an on-site computer server for older legacy systems. A restaurant POS system is a significant business investment, and it's important to treat it as such.</p>
