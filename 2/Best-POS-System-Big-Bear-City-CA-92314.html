<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them.

This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>
