<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Today's point-of-sale (POS) systems are not just cash registers anymore thanks to new technologies like mobile devices and the cloud. Mobile POS systems also opened up a ton of new sales opportunities, like opening a pop-up shop or selling at trade shows and festivals.</p>
<p>Our POS comes standard with features which will improve your entire business, without the hidden cost. Your POS may be able to take some of the more tedious or time-consuming parts of owning a small business off your hands, dramatically improving your efficiency.
