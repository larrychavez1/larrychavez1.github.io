<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet.

Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.</p>
