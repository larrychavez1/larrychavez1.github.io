<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. A POS system has features that support the rationalization of a small or large retail business's day to day operations. Runs in Offline Mode: Even when you are offline, you can punch in orders and download business reports with LimeTray restaurant software.
