<p>In the Point of Sale QuickBooks software you are able to process non-posting transactions that promise customers something in the future, as Sales Orders, Work Orders and Layaways. This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. MPOS systems are used to process payments and may have other capabilities such as inventory management , loyalty programs, sales monitoring, reporting and much more. The software is what registers, processes and stores transaction details, but there are crucial differences in how it is stored and used between different POS software systems.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

<p>In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. When deciding on a bar POS system, it's important to talk to a representative to find out if they have all the features you need, and what they will cost—often, the starter” or core” package does not include more sophisticated features like advanced reporting, the loyalty program, or granular inventory controls.</p>
