<p>As evident as the benefits of a POS system are, we found that 56 percent of single-store retailers are still not using one Instead, we found, many are still using a combination of manual methods, cash registers, QuickBooks and Excel for bookkeeping. Once the connection is restored, Revel will automatically sync your new sales data with its archives in the cloud. This not only means that you'll be able to serve a greater number of guests in a shorter amount of time, but also that your staff members can spend more time interacting with your guests and VIPs instead of maneuvering back and forth through the crowd to access a central payment terminal.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers. But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
