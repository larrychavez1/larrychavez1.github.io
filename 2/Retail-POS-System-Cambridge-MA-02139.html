<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>

Other features include simple bill splitting, staff management capabilities, inventory tracking, floor layout configurations and sales reporting. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database.</p>
<p>IPad devices provide a solution that helps eliminate order confusion, lagging service, and incomplete sales data. If the customer doesn't have the receipt, you can ask for the last four digits of their payment card and find an order to refund or discount an item. In order for a POS purchase to be completed, a PIN number, signature or for newer mobile payment technology , a fingerprint scan usually needs to be authenticated before an authorized transaction can be made.</p>
