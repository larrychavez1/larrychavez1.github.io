<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?"

Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.</p>
