<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>You get three software versions to choose from - Basic, Pro, and Multi-Store, all designed to help you ring sales, take payments, track customer data, and generate reports. Lastly, today's liquor POS software makes it easy to track individual ingredients , so you know exactly how many drinks, appetizers and other products you can offer guests before you're out of stock. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.</p>
