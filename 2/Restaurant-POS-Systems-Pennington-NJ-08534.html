<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years.

Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>A point of sale system is like a computerized cash register, it has the ability to manage inventory, creates an easier system of taking orders, increases profit and will increase the overall productivity of both your wait and kitchen staffs. Remedy- More payment options should be given to the customers. It has an app-based design and is hosted in the cloud, meaning you check sales from your phone, update employee information from any computer, and quickly update software in just a couple of minutes.</p>
