<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). All in all, I need something that will provide everything to make sales happen quickly, but protect the businesses interests most importantly. One of the biggest retail players exhibiting at the show, Retail Pro International, showcased its globally proven and completely localized, flexible mobile and desktop POS and inventory management software. Upon receiving a Square Chip Card Reader free of charge, customers are charged with flat rates.</p>
<p>When you've got the basics of good inventory management and great customer service in place, you can devote mental energy to creating an immersive, interactive experience in your stores. Vend POS is one the most flexible Retail POS Systems on the market, boasting third-party add-ons galore and compatibility with many operating systems. Now the systems that process checks and credit cards are an integral part of many POS systems.</p>

<p>Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction. Many POS systems are tailor-made and marketed to specific types of businesses, especially full-service restaurants or retail. Depending on the software, merchants can track not only their sales but also inventory levels, gross revenues, profit margins, sales patterns and a whole host of other data points.</p>
<p>The ETP Omni-channel POS software is integrated with an in-transaction CRM solution which creates a single view of the customer right from registration to billing to customer specific promotions to loyalty management.
