<h3>Retail Pro Software Solutions Berlin New Hampshire</h3>
<p>Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. Because traditional point of sale systems require you to run reports from an in-store terminal, your ability to make data-driven business decisions is limited to when you're at your business location. Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>
<p>Although its focus is hospitality businesses, salons and retail stores can also use it. You can use it to take orders tableside, track inventory at the ingredient level, manage customers, offer loyalty promotions and generate reports. With POS systems that offer this feature, you'll be able to track transaction history, take notes, and potentially even contact customers, all through your point of sale.
