<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running. The smart restaurant POS software also allows you to split guest bills by food type and quantity. Mobile payments - In business, mobile payment options have made the transactions more accessible and safer and can even improve customer service.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
