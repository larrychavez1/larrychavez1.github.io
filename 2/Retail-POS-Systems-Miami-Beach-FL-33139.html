<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more. You can analyze sales data, figure out how well all the items on your shelves sell, and adjust purchasing levels accordingly. Beyond ringing up sales and accepting payments, you want a system that streamlines related processes such as inventory and customer management. A retail POS system may also include a barcode scanner and customer-facing screen.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>
<h2>POS Dealers Miami Beach</h2>

<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet.

<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only.

While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>You avoid entering the same data twice as all sales are automatically registered in the accounts. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
