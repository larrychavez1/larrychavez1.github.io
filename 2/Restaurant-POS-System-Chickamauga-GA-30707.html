<p>When you are decided to get started in a restaurant business, there is no simpler way to get going but by opening a small pizza shop. Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality. Easy to use - Tablet and mobile POS are easier to use because the staff is already familiar with using mobile devices so that the learning curve can be shorter over the traditional point of sale machines and software. Our parent company Point of Sale USA maintains a list of the top restaurant POS systems in the industry with individual reviews to help you compare and find the right solution for your business.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
