<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>ARBA's point of sale systems serves industries across the board, from retail, cafeterias , bookstores , gift shops, pet stores , restaurants and to healthcare. Once a sale is entered, these systems automatically update inventory and accounts receivable records. That's where a point of sale system comes in. A point of sale system helps to make everything from inputting orders to inventory and even taking payment more streamlined.</p>

<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.
