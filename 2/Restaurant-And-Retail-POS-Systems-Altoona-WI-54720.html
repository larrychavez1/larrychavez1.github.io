As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner. Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments. A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service. If you have a chain of restaurants across the world and looking for a restaurant POS software to streamline your business then you can take a look at our eZee Optimus restaurant POS system.</p>

<p>Lavu gives owners and business leaders the ability to connect with their customers on a different level, by streamlining a customer interaction combined with how every team member responds to orders.
