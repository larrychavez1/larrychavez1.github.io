<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>Your customers become your shop's ultimate cheerleader, speaking positively about you within their social circles and essentially attracting new customers for you. Consolidate your inventory, customer, and staff management across all locations so that you can manage your entire business from one place. Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. POS systems also offer reliable add-ons and hardware systems such as barcode scanners, cash drawers, receipt printers, and card swipers.</p>

<p>Industry-specific POS packages are available-for auto repair shops, beauty and nail salons, video rental stores, dry cleaners and more. Vend's free POS software is good for small business owners who may only sell on occasion, such as a weekly farmer's market. VP of Oakley Retail, Erik Searles, shared with Chain Store Age how Oakley is using technology to draw customers into the brand's innovation. There's a reason the TouchBistro app is one of the most well-used and well-loved restaurant iPad POS systems for service workers: Its support team, cost-efficiency, and raft of features are among the best around.</p>
<p>Using the right POS solution for your restaurant can expedite more than just food orders. The point of sale (or POS) in retail industries uses a combination of software as well as hardware.

<h2>Pc POS System Bay Shore NY</h2>
<p>Working with leading merchant providers from around the world, Vend allows businesses to choose the best way to accept payments, including debit, credit and gift cards. Some mobile POS systems allow the server to place orders right at the table, saving on time and reducing the chances of making a mistake. TouchBistro is one of the few restaurant POS systems that have not only perfected the basic POS functionalities, but also gone beyond them to offer exclusive, out-of-the-box extras.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>Its makers, Martin Goodwin and Bob Henry, are essentially the godfathers of modern POS, this being the critical moment that preceded a slew of Point of Sale applications being developed specifically for Microsoft and Unix operating systems. A result of cloud-based servers was that retailers could start accessing their POS system by picking up any device with internet connectivity—whether it was a laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone—and logging into their business portal.</p>

<p>Its menu intelligence leverages POS data and cloud technology to help you optimize menu and inventory management. Once the inventory code is entered, the systems call up the standard or sales price, compute the price at multiple quantities and provide a running total. To find the best POS systems for small businesses, we asked small business owners which systems they use and what they like and dislike about them.</p>
<p>Inventory isn't a favorite topic among managers, but it's a top necessity for being ahead in a highly competitive business. A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. Key features include floor management, customer and inventory tracking, table-side ordering and an offline mode. Retailers who meet this requirement first will build stronger relationships with customers, create space for innovation projects, and make more strategic decisions that maximize their growth.</p>
