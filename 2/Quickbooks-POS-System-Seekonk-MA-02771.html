<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Relevant data is where data-driven profit begins, and user-defined fields in Retail Pro POS give you flexibility to add the fields for which you want to gather data. Our retail team would come to us with a bottleneck in the process, and we would create customizations in Retail Pro to fix it. We're always finding new ways to increase efficiency in our stores. The retailers can bring incentives, cross-sell, interact with shoppers, and up-sell by swiping a loyalty card.</p>
<p>So when you're at your favorite restaurant or retail shop, and you make a purchase, you are completing a point-of-sale (POS) or a point of purchase (POP) transaction. Loyalty and rewards programs will keep customers coming back time after time, and is a feature that retail POS systems can't handle. EPOS system is easy to use, and staff can be trained on it in 15 minutes. Advanced features of KORONA's automation and retail inventory management helps you identify and resolve problems to improve business operations.</p>

More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>Cost- Before finalizing the POS system, the user should consider the cost of it that includes the hardware and software price. This software has been around since 2008 and continues to be one of the best POS systems for retail. To get started, pair your POS software with one of our top inventory management software options. A vital element of POS hardware is the cash drawer. Payment is easy - at the beginning of the night, servers can start a tab in the POS for each customer, adding their name and payment card information so they don't have to ask again, allowing customers more convenience when they spend an evening in your bar.</p>

<h3>EPoS Systems In The Hospitality Industry Seekonk Massachusetts</h3>
<p>The only major complaint with QuickBooks is that it isn't recommended for many basic types of businesses, including full-service restaurants and retail stores with brick-and-mortar locations.
