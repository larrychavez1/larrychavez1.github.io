Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>

<p>While other POS systems on the market encourage you to use your own devices, Revel strongly recommends that you buy hardware directly from them for everything to go smoothly. If you have been hesitant to install a POS system, or are simply curious as to what a POS system could bring to your restaurant, it's time to consider what they have to offer. POS transaction is the state where customers offer payment for the exchange of goods and services.</p>

Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them. Note that these fees are determined by the payment processor, not by the POS provider (although sometimes the POS provider will make you use their in-house payment processor).
