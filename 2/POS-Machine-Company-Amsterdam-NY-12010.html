<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. NCR is a longtime provider of banking services, software, and hardware with experience at handling all areas of tablet POS. For retail businesses, inventory is carefully monitored and set to automatically replenish diminished inventory.

<p>It performs all those functions that the aforementioned hardware applications are capable of. Besides, modern POS software applications also help in managing inventory. In addition to the TouchSuite Restaurant POS system, it resells Grubbrr kiosks and POS hardware for Clover, Talech, QuickBooks POS, and NCR Silver.
