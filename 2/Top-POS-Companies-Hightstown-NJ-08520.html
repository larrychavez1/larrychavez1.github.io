<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>For instance, POS systems for the restaurant business can enhance customer loyalty and retention by being used for promotions via email or sms. Your customers don't have to worry about keeping cash in their pockets all the time. This computerized system allows business owners to track sales, cash flow , food inventory and can help simplify your bookkeeping enormously. QuickBooks POS is yours with a one-time payment: no more monthly, quarterly or annual payments to worry about.</p>

<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions. To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
<p>Before we jump into that, let's look at why you need a POS system , as well as the features you should look for in your POS software.
