<p>TouchBistro restaurant POS system doesn't come with purchase-ordering and vendor management capabilities. Lavu utilizes advanced restaurant hardware and technology that include self-serve kiosks and digital menu boards, which make transacting and order taking quicker and more convenient.

Clover is an advanced POS system for businesses that require highly customizable software.

<p>POS software with online ordering, inventory tracking, and gift card options for the restaurant, bar, nightclub, quickservice industry. Dinlr Waiter is a POS system for restaurants that runs on iPads and iPhones. Revel is best suited for established businesses that plan to stick with a single POS service provider for an extended period. As the sales of gift cards is increasing every year, your POS system must have the capability to manage those as well.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
