<p>Run the world's best retail with Vend POS software + PayPal. Restaurants can choose high-end table management and reservations options or minimized features needed for fast food counters to food trucks. The restaurant POS industry charges per-month costs that vary depending on the number of terminals and locations, and whether you're only using software or need hardware as well. Because cashless payments are typically quicker and more efficient, which leave the customer with more time to do their thing.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>
