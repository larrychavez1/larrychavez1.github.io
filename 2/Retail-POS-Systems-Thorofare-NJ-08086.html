<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? The PDT stores your inventory count which enables you to upload it quickly into your Point of Sale software. It offers a choice of month-to-month or annual subscription plans for its POS software, and all of its plans support an unlimited number of users, customers and products.

<p>It works with all major credit card processors and POS equipment. Customers can also interact directly with POS systems, particularly in the hospitality industry. Options like an online appointment calendar, appointment reminders, customer database with details for a previous haircut or nails styles, retail functionality, inventory management, online employee scheduling, and employee management are all vital to have.</p>
